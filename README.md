## Frequently asked questions?

#### Is this a biased list?

Somewhat. I do not know everything about Digital piracy and can be a little resistive while adding new links.

#### Why can I only search for headers onthe website?

A full-text search function is planned.
The website vuepress for easy maintainance and deployment. Vuepress currently only supports header search and algolia pluggin. I don't know how to integrate algolia in the current deployment cycle. Any help regarding this will be much appreciated.
Untill then you will have to search via `Ctrl` + `F` or `Cmd` + `F`.
