## FAQ

> Why was this even created?

Research purposes... :wink:

> But [awesome-piracy](https://github.com/Igglybuff/awesome-piracy) already exists.

It has been very inactive lately. You can think of this as a website version of awesome-piracy.

> Is this a biased list?

Somewhat. I don't know everything about piracy and can be a little resistive while adding new links.
