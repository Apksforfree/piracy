## FAQ

> Why was this even created?

Research purposes... :wink:

> Is this a biased list?

Somewhat. I do not know everything about digital piracy and can be a little resistive while adding new links.

> Why can't I do a full text search on the website?

A full-text search function is planned.
The website uses vuepress for easy maintainance and deployment.
Vuepress currently only supports header search and algolia pluggin.
I don't know how to integrate algolia in the current workflow.
Any help regarding this will be much appreciated.
Untill then you will have to search via GitHub or GitLab repository search.
