## About

This is a Wiki for piracy related topics. Very similar to [r/piracy/wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/piracy/wiki) but better organised. This wiki centralises the information already available but scattered across the internet.

This is basically a port of [Raven](https://maximousblk.github.io/raven). It was a "blog" that reached its end-of-life before it was even completed just because I was a jerk and didn't make proper credits system for it.
