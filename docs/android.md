# Android

::: warning

You can't download paid android apps for free from the official Google Play Store. Paid apps are bound to your Google Account. If an app/website tells you otherwise, it is most probably a lie.

You can only do the "[refund trick](https://www.androidauthority.com/how-to-get-refund-apps-google-play-store-673644/)" or download _precracked_ apps from mobilism and other (trusted) - places!.
