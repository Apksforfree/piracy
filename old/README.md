# VirusTotal alternatives

Overall strategy:

-   Diversify your analysis approach.
-   Don't rely on the results from a single tool.
-   Run everything with as few privileges as necessary.
-   APT investigations must be seperated from commodity malware, otherwise you give malware authors "ideas".
-   Treat everything like it could be malicious until you have enough evidence to suggest otherwise.

# MagisK Modules

**Important**: There are lots of misinformation that modules like XPrivacyLua, Device ID Maske, XPosed & Co. "hardening" your OS or parts of your apps in order to make them more "secure" or "private". This is wrong, as explained over [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/GrapheneOS/comments/ch5kv8/is_magisk_and_edxposedxprivacylua_working/). Such FUD and scam modules/apps do not offer any privacy nor security layer (keep also in mind that "underground" and dangerous modules are not listed officially on the official repositories). Please keep in mind that if you like a secure and private OS then stay away from all rooting methods, scripts or engines and use the naked (hardened) OS with only the apps which are regularily getting audited e.g. Threema, Riot etc. The modules which are listed here are "helpful" in a sense that they "add" xyz (missing) function to the OS itself and not meant to secure/hardening something.

That been said, there are no apps listed which altering your HOSTS file or apps which claim to somehow "optimize" your battery life. For ad-blocking use AdGuard/Blokada on Android (it's better than messing around with your HOSTS file) and (in general) use as less as possible on apps/modules resources compared to other solutions.

There is a universal rule for Android:

-   More apps -> more background processes/traffic (startups etc.) + cpu cycles consumption = more battery drain, it's really that simple!.
